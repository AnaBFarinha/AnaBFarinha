## Hi, I'm Ana  üëã

# üí´ About Me:
Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a Master's student in Data Science & Advanced Analytics at Nova Information Management School in Lisbon, Portugal. My path into this field has been shaped by a lifelong curiosity about how things work, a love for problem-solving, and a growing fascination with the power of data to answer complex questions.<br><br>What first drew me to data science was its perfect blend of mathematics, logic, and creativity. I enjoy the structured thinking behind algorithms just as much as I enjoy the process of finding stories hidden in the numbers. Over time, this passion has only grown stronger.<br><br>During my academic journey, I've worked with tools like Python and R, developed machine learning models, built data pipelines, and explored topics ranging from predictive analytics to natural language processing. I particularly enjoy the challenge of building models that not only perform well, but also make sense in a business context. It‚Äôs in that intersection ‚Äî between data, technology, and real-world impact ‚Äî that I feel most inspired.<br><br>Outside the classroom, I‚Äôm constantly learning. Whether it‚Äôs experimenting with new techniques in a side project, reading up on the latest research, or teaching what I know to others, I believe in growing through doing. I recently started diving deeper into reinforcement learning and time series forecasting, and I'm always on the lookout for new ideas to explore or interesting problems to solve.<br>

## üíª What you'll find here<br>
<br>This GitHub profile is a collection of projects that reflect both what I‚Äôve learned and what I‚Äôm curious about. Most of the repositories here come from academic work, but many also come from personal interests and explorations.<br><br>Some examples of what you‚Äôll find:<br>- Machine learning projects (classification, regression, clustering)<br>- Exploratory data analysis<br>- Deep learning projects<br><br>Each project is a learning experience, and I try to document my thinking along the way ‚Äî not just the results, but the process too.<br>
